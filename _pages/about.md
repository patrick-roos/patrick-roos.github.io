Iâ€™m a Computer Scientist and currently head the Machine Learning (ML) Product team at <a href='https://www.theknotww.com/'>The Knot Worldwide</a>. Previously I was Chief Data Scientist at <a href='https://zdatainc.com/'>Atos zData</a>, a Data Science and AI practice of Atos focused on intelligent end-to-end solutions in North America. I came to zData via <a href="https://atos.net/en/2020/press-release_2020_04_22/atos-acquires-data-science-firm-miner-kasch"> acquisition of Miner & Kasch</a>, an AI and Data Science consulting firm where I was a Principal Data Scientist and helped the company grow from 4 to 30+ employees.

Before joining the industry world I did research at the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a> and in the Artificial Intelligence Group at the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">University of Maryland (UMD)</a>. I received my Ph.D. (2012) and M.S. in Computer Science at the UMD, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/">Dana Nau</a> and <a href="https://www.michelegelfand.com/">Michele Gelfand<a/>. My interest in applying Computer and Data Science to interdisciplinary work launched under <a href="https://blogs.cofc.edu/manaris/">Bill Manaris<a/> furing my B.S. in Data Science at the College of Charleston (2007).

I grew up in Bavaria, Germany and became a US citizen after having lived in the US for over about half of my life. Outside of work I spend a lot of time training and competing in Muay Thai.
